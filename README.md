# scottcolfer.github.io
This is my personal website and blog (I'm Scott Colfer).
My content focuses on product management.

## How?
Hosting is provded by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
Posts are written using [Markdown](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf).
Layouts are created using HTML and CSS.
I created this site using Jonathan McGlone's [excellent tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

## Why?
I've written a post explaining why I'm [cheating on WordPress with GitHub Pages and Jekyll](http://scottcolfer.github.io/2016/04/09/personal-site-github-pages-jekyll.html).

I write blog posts to help me figure out concepts, collaborate with peers and return weeks/months/years later to see what I thought in the past.

## Can I borrow?
Feel free to fork my repository and get a head start on your own free, static website. 

## Can I help?
If you have the time and inclincation to share your insights then it'll (usually) be welcome. I often leave specific questions in my posts. If you notice any technical issues with my website (anything from a typo to a CSS fail) then it'll nearly always be welcome (I'm here to learn). GitHub or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottcolfer) are the best ways to get in touch. 

Cheers!
