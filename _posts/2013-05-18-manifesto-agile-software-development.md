I've just been on a SCRUM refresher and it made me think that now's a good time to revisit the manifesto for agile software development (aka the Agile Manifesto).

"**Manifesto for Agile Software Development.**

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan.

That is, while we value the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."
