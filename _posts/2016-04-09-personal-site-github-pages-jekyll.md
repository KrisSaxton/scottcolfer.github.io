# Intro
I'm writing this blog post using [Markdown](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf) and publishing it as a static website thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The blog component is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). This is a short blog post to explain how and why I'm doing this.

## tl;dr
I've blogged using WordPress since 2009 but been frustrated that backing-up posts wasn't easy. Greater familiarity with GitHub is useful for my current product. GitHub hosts a free, static site for each user, GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages can be married with Jekyll to create a blog hosted on GitHub.

## How
Jonathan McGlone has published an excellent [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Follow it and you'll create your own blog too. The tutorial assumes very little knowledge and covers [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (version control system), [GitHub](https://github.com/) (hosting service for development using Git), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (free web pages from GitHub) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (a 'static' site generator, based on templates). You'll then start writing blog posts using [Markdown](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf).

## 5 Whys
Why am I cheating on WordPress?

### 1. GitHub
I'd like to become a more sophisticated user of GitHub and I assume that regular, practical use is the best way to learn.

### 2. Documentation
I'm a product owner and have [written](http://scottcolfer.com/technical-product-manager/) about the importance of separating my product backlog from my development team's sprint backlog, but I could usefully have more knowledge of their activity and feedback they receive from our users in the form of issues. We believe in the agile manifesto, including 'working software over compprehensive documentation', but what we're finding is a need for more documentation so that we can remember and evidence user feedback and action we've taken as a result. Our delivery manager smartly suggested making better use of GitHub before creating a new artefact so any opportunity for me increase my understanding of GitHub in a practical sense without becoming a drain on the team (i.e. getting them to show me it) is valuable. My [personal website](http://scottcolfer.com/) has been active for years and is clearly something I regularly work on, so re-creating it using GitHub Pages and Jekyll should give me opportunities to learn more about GitHub in a practical sense. 

### 3.Backup
WordPress is awesome. Back in 2009 (when I became more interested in web development because of the products I was working on), WordPress was a fantastic way to get online quickly. I wrote a now defunct food blog called 'The Boy Can Cook' that had a regular audience in the hundreds and led to some cool things (reviews, events, freebies). Working with charities, social enterprises and startups, WordPress has been (and continues to be) a great way to make your mark. Services I've led like [Young Dads TV](http://youngdads.tv/), [Mind of My Own](http://www.mindofmyown.org.uk/), and [Disclose Me](http://disclose.me.uk/) (to name a few amongst many) have all benefitted from the WordPress universe.
