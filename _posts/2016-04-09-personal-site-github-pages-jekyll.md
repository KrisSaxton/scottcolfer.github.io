# Intro
I'm writing this blog post using [Markdown](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf) and publishing it as a static website thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The blog component is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). This is a short blog post to explain how and why I'm doing this.

## tl;dr
I've blogged using WordPress since 2009 but been frustrated that backing-up posts wasn't easy. Greater familiarity with GitHub is useful for my current product. GitHub hosts a free, static site for each user, GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages can be married with Jekyll to create a blog hosted on GitHub.

## How
Jonathan McGlone has published an excellent [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Follow it and you'll create your own blog too. The tutorial assumes very little knowledge and covers [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (version control system), [GitHub](https://github.com/) (hosting service for development using Git), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (free web pages from GitHub) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (a 'static' site generator, based on templates). You'll then start writing blog posts using [Markdown](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf).
